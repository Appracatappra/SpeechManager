`SpeechManager` is a simple utility for adding text-to-speech to your app quickly and easily.

## Support

If you find `SpeechManager` useful and would like to help support its continued development and maintenance, please consider making a small donation, especially if you are using it in a commercial product:

It's through the support of contributors like yourself, I can continue to build, release and maintain high-quality, well documented Swift Packages like `SpeechManager` for free.

## Installation

**Swift Package Manager** (Xcode 11 and above)

1. In Xcode, select the **File** > **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦** menu item.
2. Paste `https://github.com/Appracatappra/SpeechManager.git` in the dialog box.
3. Follow the Xcode's instruction to complete the installation.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or blank?

Supporting multiple dependency managers makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.

Since, the **Swift Package Manager** is integrated with Xcode 11 (and greater), it's the easiest choice to support going further.

## Overview

`SpeechManager` provides a simply way to have your App read text out loud.

### User Preference Options

`SpeechManager` has a build in User Preference property to control speaking:

```
/// If `true` the app will read text aloud, else it will not.
@AppStorage("speakText") public var speakText: Bool = true
```

You can provide a UI in your App to allow the end user to control their speech preferences.

### How To Use

`SpeechManager` provides several functions for controlling speech in your app. The most commonly user are:

* **sayPhrase** - `public func sayPhrase(_ text:String)` Reads the given text aloud.
* **sayPhrase** - `public func sayPhrase(_ text:String, inVoice:VoiceLanguage)` Reads the given text aloud in the given language.
* **stopSpeaking** - `public func stopSpeaking()` Stops the current text from being read aloud.

#### Languages

The `VoiceLanguage` enumeration defines the language specific voices that you can use to say a phrase:

```
public enum VoiceLanguage: String {
    case arabicSaudiArabia = "ar-SA"
    case czechCzechRepublic = "cs-CZ"
    case danishDenmark = "da-DK"
    case germanGermany = "de-DE"
    case greekModernGreece = "el-GR"
    case englishAustralia = "en-AU"
    case englishUnitedKingdom = "en-GB"
    case englishIreland = "en-IE"
    case englishIndia = "en-IN"
    case englishUnitedStates = "en-US"
    case englishSouthAfrica = "en-ZA"
    case spanishMexico = "es-MX"
    case spanishSpain = "es-ES"
    case finnishFinland = "fi-FI"
    case frenchCanada = "fr-CA"
    case frenchFrance = "fr-FR"
    case hebrewIsrael = "he-IL"
    case hindiIndia = "hi-IN"
    case indonesianIndonesia = "id-ID"
    case italianItaly = "it-IT"
